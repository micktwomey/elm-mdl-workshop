# Elm MDL Workshop

Content for a short workshop given in the Elm Dublin Meetup, June 2017.

This workshop is a little bit of an intro to Elm and little bit of an intro to elm-mdl (Material Design Light library for Elm).

## Setting up

1. Install [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html). Alternatively you can edit via [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com). (Lot's of cut and paste though. TODO: If someone has time put the code up there  and add links :))
2. Run `elm reactor` and go to http://localhost:8000
3. Code lives in `src`

## Optional

- Install [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format), most plugins can use this to auto-format code.

## Recommended Editors

1. Visual Studio Code + Elm Plugin + elm-format plugin
2. SublimeText 3 + Elm Plugin
3. Atom + Elm plugin
